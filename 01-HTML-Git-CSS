- Which browsers support HTML5?

IDK. Either just Chrome or essentially all but IE. If I had to choose, I'd pick all but IE...although actually I'd just look it up!

- Which two attributes should every `<img>` element have?

src= seems like the lone mandatory attribute. Perhaps the question is driving at alt=? I'll look it up...

ANSWER: Documentation says both alt= and src= are required fields, but Chrome does not enforce this and allows either or even none.

- What's the difference between a class selector and an id selector?

class selectors may appear as often as desired and are prefixed in the css stylesheet with a '.'. id selectors must be unique and thus identify a single element. id selectors are prefixed by '#" in the .css

- Why is it preferable to use external style sheets instead of inline CSS?

Preferable seems so subjective; however, inline CSS statements seem objectively less flexible. This becomes especially obvious with shared .css like that achieved through well-designed class definitions.

- What are the advantages of using Git?

Once committed, nothing is ever lost. It greatly simplifies the coordination of changes between multiple developers
